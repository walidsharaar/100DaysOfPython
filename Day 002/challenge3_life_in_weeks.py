'''
Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks,
months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly,
even the positions of the commas and full stops.
'''

age= input("Enter your age:\n")

# substract current age from 90
age =90 - int(age)

# change the year to months, days and weeks

days= round(age*365)
months=round(age*12)
weeks = round(age*52)

print(f"user has {days} days,{weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
