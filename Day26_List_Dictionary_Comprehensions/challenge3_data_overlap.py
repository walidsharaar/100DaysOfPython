'''
List Comprehension 3

ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD
Instructions

Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

e.g. if file1.txt contained:

1

2

3

and file2.txt contained:

2

3

4

result = [2, 3]

IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
Example Output

[3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
'''

with open("file1.txt")as file1:
    file_1_data = file1.readlines()

with open("file2.txt") as file2:
    file_2_data = file2.readlines()

result = [int(num) for num in file_1_data if num in file_2_data]





# Write your code above ðŸ‘†

print(result)
